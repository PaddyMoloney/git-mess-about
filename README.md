## Code Chatter - Week 3

This week we really introduced CSS and all its styling glory. We took our basic, un-styled portfolio page to the next level and adjusted the styling for our structure to give it a more friendly user experience and presentation.

View the [basic-notes](https://github.com/Shopify/code-chatter/blob/week-3/basic-notes.md) or [intermediate-notes](https://github.com/Shopify/code-chatter/blob/week-3/intermediate-notes.md) files for more specific reference material for each of these.
